Error:
- Mean squared error (MSE): The MSE is a measure of the average squared error between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better fit.
- R-squared: The R-squared is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit.
- Adjusted R-squared: The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the R-squared that takes into account the number of features in the model. A higher adjusted R-squared indicates a better fit, but it is less sensitive to the number of features than the R-squared.
- Mean absolute error (MAE): The MAE is a measure of the average absolute error between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower MAE indicates a better fit.
